    I joined TSA in freshman year after being influenced by the club advisor and my friends who were in the club. My original expectations about what TSA was were somewhat correct, however, I did not realize how many categories there truly were for competitions. My goal was to participate in the programming competition which led to me learning Scratch as that was the language used in the competition. This experience of learning a programming language had left an impact on me. This impact was further amplified by one of my first AP courses, AP Computer Science. Through these 2 experiences, my like for learning and improving my understanding of different programming languages was born.

    After being recognized by my grades and efforts put into my freshman year of high school, I had been granted the opportunity to join the National Honors Society as a sophomore. This decision was very impactful as the NHS has taught me a lot about how to improve myself and the importance of being involved in community activities. To promote the importance of community service, NHS has a 20 hours of community service requirement each year. Despite not being involved in too many community services activities until this point, soon after joining NHS I learned the true need for community service. Eventually, I began to do more community service than just what was required, ending up with almost double the hours required in my junior year.

    	I had decided to check out this club because of playing with my dad when I was younger. And while I had this experience with chess, it was only a game in the end. I wasn’t making an effort to get better as at that time it was just a game that I would occasionally play. However, soon after attending these chess club meetings and meeting many players who were better than me, I decided to do some research. Instead of only playing on the days of club I was actively looking into chess and trying to get better. What started out as just having some fun with my dad and at the club expanded into a hobby that I actively spent my free time doing. Such an experience illuminated my want to learn something and eventually become a hobby.

    History has always felt like a game of pure memorization and learning something just for the sake of learning it rather than to work with that knowledge. Model UN gave me that something to do with the knowledge I had gained during my history classes. Not only did it make me rethink my viewpoint on history, but also developed many skills like speech writing, public speaking, persuasive arguments, etc. Taking challenging history classes like AP U.S and Comparative Government, and AP U.S. History provided me with a knowledge base that helped me have a better understanding of my role within the club.

    Currently I have around 60+ hours of community service. For the past 2 years I have participated in Project Linus which involves donating blankets for those in need and have volunteered at many seasonal events – Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, annual events. Through these contributions I have realized that some of these events or achievements of some organizations are only possible because of those who volunteer.

    SLP is a program which attempts to encourage and help students take steps for a better future. By providing a plethora of information, tours of workplaces and colleges, meetings with professionals in a variety of fields, forcing us to leave our comfort zone with public speaking, interacting with others outside of our school, etc. This program is an experience that is meant to show us how important our future is and provide us with skills that benefit that future. It has personally helped me gain knowledge about many different programs or opportunities available to me.
